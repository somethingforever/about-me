# about-me
Basecly my portfolio, that i yet need to work, but sense githup doesn't have some kind of description function ill say this:

# HELLO THERE
Welcome to my world, the something forever world... kind of , i really wish that that would be a company or a real website, basecly my dream hehe. Enough about it, my name is Red tear as you can see from my profile. Actualy i have and have been called many names but for now Red tear can do, I am 20 years old, live in portugal lisbon with my papa and mama and lil bra. I love to animate but also starting to love more to code, specialy javascript because... FIREWORKDS, ANIMATIONS, INTERACTIONS, MANIPULATIONS!!! Also you may be wondering, "oh look a pink (i prefer purple but meh XD) furry (prefer raccoon... ok yeah still furry) blushing and with those weird eyes and stars and that exitment omg (i prefer... oh you got it right) gaaayyyy" (i... well actualy ill leave you on that tought ). Ok with that in mind ill just give you a tip, i don't care how people look and not as much as i show my personality as well but i truely LOVE to play/manipulate minds (ofc i wont force some one to do something that they don't want unless it is necessary) like javascript... kind of XD. We can talk better if you wish to know me better on know who or what i truely am, it will be quite intresting =w=.

Have a great day or night or afternoon
Sleep well
Be happy
Have lots of love from those who care the most
Be a good boy or a good girl
Don't be fooled

Best regards,
Red Tear
